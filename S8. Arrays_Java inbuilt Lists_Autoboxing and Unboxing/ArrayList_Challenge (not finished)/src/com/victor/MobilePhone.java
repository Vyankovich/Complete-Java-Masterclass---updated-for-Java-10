// create a program that implements a simple phone with the following capabilities
// able to store, modify, remove and query contact names.
// you will want to c create a separate class for Contacts (name and phone number).
// create a master class (MobilePhone) that holds the ArrayList of Contacts
// the MobilePhone class has the functionality listed above.
// Add a menu of options that are available.
// Options: Quit, print list of contacts, add new contact, update existing contact, remove contact
// and search/find contact.
// When adding or updating be sure to check if the contact already exists (use name)
// e.g. no ints, no .get(i) etc.
// MobilePhone should do everything with Contact objects only.
